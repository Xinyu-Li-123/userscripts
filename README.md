This is a collection of useful userscripts for TamperMonkey. The folder structure is 

```
myscript/
├── myscript.js
└── README.md
```

For a userscript named `myscript`, we will create a folder `myscript`, which contains `myscript.js` (the actual userscript) and `REAMDE.md` (explanation of the userscript)
